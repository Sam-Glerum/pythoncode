800 years ago, the earth as we know it, was infested with a terrible plague cast upon it by Dark Powers.
These Dark Powers originated from a fusion of two Corrupted minds; Ashkan Morgai and Sorgo Godas.

(Merathion)
Ashkan Morgai was a general of the Kaibaedi, the most elite of all warriors in the lands of Manjeia, Sorgo Godas was his lieutenant, and together they defended the lands against invasions from the Dwellaers. The Dwellaers were hideous, unearthly creatures with 3 eyes, razor-sharp teeth and a lust for blood. Their skin was pale, for they rarely see light in their homes. The Dwellaers live in the caves of the earth, where they serve their Master.

One day, Ashkan and Sorgo's warband were attacked by a huge mob of Dwellaers, and they were defeated.
Ashkan's army was slain, except for himself and Sorgo, for the Dwellaers had received an order to bring them alive to their Master.
And so they were brought deep down inside the earth, to the deepest and darkest cave of all. It was there where the Master has made his lair.

They walked down long stairs carved from stone, and were set before the Master, who sat upon a throne made out of painted skulls. The paintings were Skechs of the Old Language. The Skechs held tremendous power, if painted correctly.
The throne had a velvet-red glow pulsing around it, and fresh blood dripped from the dais on which the throne stood.


After the failed attempt to overthrow the Manjeian rulers, Ashkan and Sorgo were sentenced to die on the top of Goremoth, a large mountain in the south of Manjeia. They were chained to a giant tree, The Burning Tree it was called, for on top of the enormous tree, a dragon lived. The dragon had many names, most of which were of the Old Tongue, which no one could speak, for the language was older than the tree itself, and it's secrets were long forgotten.
